# TETRIS
 v1.0

This is my first big project. For pictrures check the IMAGES folder there are some pictures and vids for you to understand better the idea.
The whole project is written in C++ by me except the music part which is in the bottom of main file.
If you want to check the schematics you can open the KICAD folder.
Also you can notice that there is no top_btn in the code and in schematics as well as the 4x4 matrix. That is because when I finally soldered the project there was some issues with pins.
So eventually to make the project trully finished it is better to take two shifting registers and put plus on them insted of wiring it directly to the controller. Guess that is just rookie mistake though:)
So if you would like to ask smth about code or schematics or anything else feel free to do it. Also every feedback will be appreciated.
